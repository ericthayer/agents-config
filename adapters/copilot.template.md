### Architecture

Follow component architecture patterns defined in the shared rules. Key principles:

1. **Composition over inheritance** - Prefer composable components
2. **Single responsibility** - Each component has one clear purpose
3. **Accessibility first** - ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation built-in

### Code Style

- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow React 19+ patterns (use hooks, avoid class components)
- Prefer Server Components where appropriate

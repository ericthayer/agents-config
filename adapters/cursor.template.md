### Active Rules
{{RULES_LIST}}

### Skills (in .agents/skills/)

- `.agents/skills/accessibility-audit/SKILL.md` - WCAG compliance checking
- `.agents/skills/scaffold-component/SKILL.md` - Component generation
- `.agents/skills/integrate-gemini/SKILL.md` - AI feature patterns

## Code Generation Rules

When generating code, follow these principles:

### Component Structure

- Export named components (not default exports)
- Use TypeScript with explicit prop types
- Include JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Add data-testid attributes for testing

### Accessibility Requirements

- All interactive elements must be keyboard accessible
- Provide aria-labels for icon-only buttons
- Ensure color contrast meets WCAG 2.2 AA
- Include focus indicators

### Performance Considerations

- Use React.memo() for expensive components
- Lazy load routes and heavy components
- Avoid inline object/function definitions in JSX

## File Patterns

When creating files:

- Components: `PascalCase.tsx`
- Hooks: `useCamelCase.ts`
- Utils: `kebab-case.ts`
- Tests: `*.test.ts` or `*.spec.ts`

## IDE-Specific Caveats

> This file uses Markdown format but has no file extension.

### Cursor-Specific Tips

- Cursor uses Claude under the hood - same reasoning capabilities
- Use @-mentions to reference files in chat
- Cursor's Composer works best with clear, scoped requests
- Keep .cursorrules under 10KB for optimal performance

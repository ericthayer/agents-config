### AI Integration (Gemini-Specific)

When integrating Gemini features into this project, follow the patterns in:
- `.agents/rules/gemini.md` - Gemini integration guidelines
- `.agents/skills/integrate-gemini/SKILL.md` - Integration workflow

## Code Generation Preferences

### TypeScript Standards

- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Prefer interfaces over type aliases for object shapes
- Use discriminated unions for state management
- Avoid `any` - use `unknown` with type guards

### React Patterns

- Functional components with hooks only
- Server Components by default (Next.js)
- Client Components marked with 'use client'
- Suspense boundaries for async operations

### Accessibility

All generated code must include:
- Semantic HTML elements
- ARIA attributes where needed
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly content

### Gemini-Specific Tips

- Gemini excels at multimodal tasks - include images/screenshots when helpful
- Use structured prompts with clear sections
- Gemini handles long contexts well - include full file contents when needed
- For code generation, specify the exact file path and format expected
